# ESP32 Temperature/Humidity Datalogger

Work in progress to make a simple datalogger to record temperature and humidity over the course of a day. Especially curious about the maximum temperature the inside of my car reaches. 

May add remote data uploading from the esp32

There is a secret library that just contains the variables for the WiFi name and password that is not included on github, you'd have to make your own to make it work
